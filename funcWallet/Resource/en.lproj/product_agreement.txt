Dear users:
The document was created to actualize our ideas and goal setting.

     Â We can guarantee that we intend to fulfill our plan and move towards our goals, while creating something that we could not know about at the time of writing this document. But we cannot guarantee that we will do everything, due to the youth of technology and constant rapid changes. Flexibility of projects and competent allocation of resources are one of the main conditions for survival and successful development.

     Investing in cryptocurrencies is associated with high risk. Never invest what you are not ready to lose. Make all decisions yourself.
